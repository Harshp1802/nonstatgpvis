    "Gaussian Processes (GP) are powerful supervised learning methods, designed to solve classification and regression problems. One of the major advantages of using Gaussian processes is that it can estimate the uncertainty of its predictions by describing the probability distributions of the potentially infinite functions that fit the data. It can be defined as a stochastic process of random variables following a Gaussian distribution with a mean and a covariance function."
